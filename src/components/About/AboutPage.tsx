                The earliest version of <b>Supervisor</b> was developed in 2019 when I was a sophomore student. It
                accompanied me for a half year, and I kept myself self-disciplined with its assistance. But after then I
                indulged myself in playing computer games due to the Covid-19 Lockdown Policy, not using it anymore.
                Even worse, I lost all my source code after wrongly formatting my computer without pushing it to any
                remote repository.

                Now, I am suffering from the desperation of solitary after immigrating to the United States, without a
                chance to go to university and pursue my favorite subject, computer science. Next month my family will
                move to Boston, a city with better social security than Chicago, where I am living right now. I hope I
                can restart my transient life there.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body1' mb={1}>
                By remaking <b>Supervisor</b>, I want myself to delve into study once again, just like what I did three
                years ago. My friends, coworkers, classmates, teammates, all of you guys can supervise me and witness my
                growth and change.
